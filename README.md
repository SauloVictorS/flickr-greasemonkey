### Non-reciprocal Contacts Finder
Flickr used to have a Contacts List feature which displayed a list of members who had not added you back. This view was removed after public beta testing because it caused "drama". For those of us who are adults, however, seeing this information is useful because the site enforces a limit of 2,000 non-reciprocal contacts after which you cannot add more. The non-reciprocal contacts finder will highlight in red those contacts who have not reciprocated, allowing you to prune your list should you ever hit the 2K contact limit.

With the recent update, it is now possible to know who added you as a friend and family.
non-reciprocal contacts will be red marked.
Contacts that have added you as a friend will be marked in green.
Contacts that have added you as a family will be marked in purple.
Contacts not added you not as family or friend and will remain marked in blue.
